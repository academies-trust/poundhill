The academy has a Supplemental Funding Agreement (SFA) which includes the policy on admissions arrangements in the academy. The admissions policy will shortly be published <a href="https://www.brighton.ac.uk/academiestrust/how-we-work/our-policies/index.aspx" target="_blank">here.</a></p>

				<h4>Oversubscription Criteria</h4>
				<p>Pupils will be admitted according to the following Admissions Oversubscription Criteria.</p>
				<p>Where the number of applications for admission is greater than the published admission number, applications will be considered against the criteria set out below. After the admission of pupils with Statements of Special Education Needs where the academy is named on the statement or Education Healthcare Plan, the criteria will be applied in the order in which they are set out below:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>1.	Looked after children (children in public care) and children who were previously looked after who leave care under a special guardianship or residence order. Evidence must be provided.</li>
					<li>2.	Children who need a place at the academy on exceptional and compelling social, psychological or medical grounds. Evidence must be provided.</li>
					<li>3.	Children who live in the catchment area who have brothers or sisters already at the academy at the time of application and will still be in the academy at the time of admission. Brothers or sisters may be half or step-siblings (by marriage or co-habitation) or foster siblings but must be living permanently at the same address.</li>
					<li>4.	Other children who live in the catchment area.</li>
					<li>5.	Children who live outside the catchment area who have brothers or sisters already at the academy at the time of application and will still be in the academy at the time of admission. Brothers or sisters may be half or step-siblings (by marriage or co-habitation) or foster siblings but must be living permanently at the same address.</li>
					<li>6.	Other children who live outside the catchment area</li>
				</ol>
				<!--<p>Details of the catchment area for the academy is shown on the diagram available <a href="{{url()}}/docs/Holmbush Primary Catchment Map.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>-->
				<h4>Tie breaker - oversubscription</h4>
				<p>If there are more children who qualify for a place than places available, places will be allocated to pupils living closest to the academy (using the shortest distance from home to school using a straight line distance. All distances are measured by a straight line from the academy to the child’s home address, using Ordnance Survey address point data from a central point in each building.</p> 
				<h3>In Year Admissions <small>(Applications to the academy outside the normal admissions round)</small></h3>
				<p>Pupils and families wishing to apply for places outside the normal admissions round (including years 1 to 6, and applications to join the academy part way through the Reception Year) should, in the first instance, contact the Admissions Manager at the University of Brighton Academies Trust by email (AcademiesTrust@brighton.ac.uk) or by post:</p>
				<address>
					<p><strong>University of Brighton Academies Trust Admissions Manager</strong><br />
					University of Brighton<br />
					Multi Academy Trust Office<br />
					Checkland Building Room E345<br />
					Falmer<br />
					BN1 9PH</p>
				</address>
				<p>If you wish to query availability of spaces please email the Trust’s Admissions Manager <a href="mailto:academiestrust@brighton.ac.uk">(AcademiesTrust@brighton.ac.uk)</a> stating clearly to which academy you are referring and the year group in which you are interested.</p>
				<p>The oversubscription criteria referred to above also apply where the number of applications for in year admission is greater than the number of places.</p>
				<h3>Admissions Numbers</h3>
				<p>Pound Hill Infant Academy has a Published Admission Number of 30, which applies to the Reception Year only. Admissions to other year groups are based upon (a) the size of teaching groups already existing in the academy and (b) the efficient use of resources.</p>
				<h3>Waiting Lists</h3>
				<p>Pound Hill Infant Academy will operate a waiting list. Where in any year the academy receives more applications for places than there are places available, a waiting list will operate for unsuccessful applicants to the Reception Year. Waiting lists will also be maintained for other year groups when these year groups are full.</p>
				<p>If you would like to place your child’s name on the waiting list for the relevant year group following an unsuccessful application, please submit your request in writing to the Trust’s Admissions Manager <a href="mailto:academiestrust@brighton.ac.uk">(AcademiesTrust@brighton.ac.uk)</a>.</p>
				<p>A child’s position on the waiting list will be determined solely in accordance with the oversubscription criteria set out above. When places become vacant they will be allocated to children on the waiting list in accordance with the oversubscription criteria.</p>
				<div class="grey-container padding-x2 margin-bottom spacer">
					<h3>Appeals</h3>
					<p>If the academy has more applications than places, parents whose child has not been allocated a place may appeal.</p>
					<p>Appeals will be considered by an independent appeals panel.</p>
