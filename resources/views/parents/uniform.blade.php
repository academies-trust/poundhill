In the summer girls may wear pink checked gingham dresses. Footwear should be plain black shoes or plain black boots (with no loose attachments such as tassels).

					<h3>P.E. Kit</h3>

				<p>
					In Key Stage 1 (Yrs. 1 and 2) the Academy PE uniform is Maroon shorts and a plain white round neck t-shirt plus a pair of black plimsolls.
					</p>
				<p>
					Children in Early Years can bring in their own PE kit consisting of a pair of shorts and a t-shirt.
					</p>
				<p>
					As some of the P.E. lessons will take place outside (weather permitting) every child should also have a non-branded,non-logo tracksuit and a pair of plimsolls or lightweight trainers with velcro fastening as part of their P.E.kit.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>All PE kit/uniform should be kept in a PE bag on the childâ€™s cloakroom peg.</strong>
